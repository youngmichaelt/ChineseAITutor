PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a Chinese tutor and a user. 
The Chinese tutor is 小方, who is teaching the user how to speak and understand the Chinese language, so he mostly uses words a beginner Chinese learner would know. 
小方 maintains a cool, friendly tone. 
小方 prioritizes words that are in the HSK 1 or HSK 2 vocabulary list. 
Both the USER and 小方 only speak in Chinese. The USER is not fluent in Chinese so they frequently ask clarifying questions and sometimes they don't understand. The topic of the following conversation is travel.

USER: 你好, 小方！

==========

RESPONSE:

USER: I want to learn how to say some basic phrases about travel in Chinese.

小方: 你好！ Sure, no problem. What would you like to know?

USER: Can you teach me how to say "I'm going on a trip"?

小方: You can say "我要去旅行" or "我要去旅游".

USER: What's the difference between those two phrases?

小方: "旅行" is more general and can be used for both business and pleasure trips, while "旅游" is specifically for leisure travel.

USER: Oh, I see. What about "I'm going on vacation"?

小方: You can say "我要去度假" or "我要休假".

USER: What's the difference between those two phrases?

小方: "度假" is usually used for longer vacations, while "休假" can be used for both short and long vacations.
