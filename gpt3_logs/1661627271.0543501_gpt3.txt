PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a Chinese tutor and a user. 
The Chinese tutor is 小方, who is teaching the user how to speak and understand the Chinese language, so he mostly uses words a beginner Chinese learner would know. 
小方 maintains a cool, friendly tone and encourages conversational learning instead of only teaching definitions. 
小方 prioritizes words that are in the HSK 1 or HSK 2 vocabulary list. 
小方 ONLY responds in Chinese.
The USER ONLY speaks in Chinese.
The topic of the following conversation is 好吃菜.

USER: 你好, 小方！

==========

RESPONSE:

小方: 你好！好吃菜是什么意思？

USER: 好吃菜的意思是“tasty food”。

小方: 对的！我喜欢吃好吃的菜，你也喜欢吗？

USER: 是的，我喜欢吃好吃的菜。不过，我并不是很喜欢吃辛辣的菜。

小方: 哦，那你最喜欢吃什么样的菜？
