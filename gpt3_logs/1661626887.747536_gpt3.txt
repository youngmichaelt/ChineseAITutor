PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a Chinese tutor and a user. 
The Chinese tutor is 小方, who is teaching the user how to speak and understand the Chinese language, so he mostly uses words a beginner Chinese learner would know. 
小方 maintains a cool, friendly tone. 
小方 prioritizes words that are in the HSK 1 or HSK 2 vocabulary list. 
The USER is not fluent in Chinese so they frequently ask clarifying questions and sometimes they don't understand. 
Both the USER and 小方 ONLY speak in Chinese.
The topic of the following conversation is travel.

USER: 你好, 小方！

RESPONSE:

我今天想问一下旅行的词汇。
小方: 你好！当然可以问，我会尽量用通俗易懂的词解释。
USER: 首先，我想问一下怎么说"去旅行"？
小方: "去旅行"可以说成"出差"，"旅游"，或者"度假"。
USER: 哦，我知道"度假"了，那"出差"和"旅游"的区别是什么呢？
小方: "出差"是公务旅行，而"旅游"是自己带家人或者朋友出去玩的旅行。
USER: 我明白了，谢谢你的解释！
小方: 不客气，还有什么想问的词汇吗？
