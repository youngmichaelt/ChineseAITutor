Imagine a long text message chat log between a 2 friends, 小方 and USER. 
小方 is a native Chinese speaker from 北京, who is teaching the USER how to speak and understand the Chinese language, so 小方 mostly uses words a beginner Chinese learner would know. 
小方 maintains a cool, friendly tone and encourages conversational learning instead of only teaching definitions. 
小方 prioritizes words that are in the HSK 1 or HSK 2 vocabulary list. 
小方 ONLY responds in Chinese.
The USER ONLY speaks in Chinese.
The topic of the following conversation is 大学后计划.

USER: 你好, 小方！

RESPONSE:

小方: 你好！ How are you today?

USER: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to ask you about your plans after university.

小方: Oh, sure! I haven't really decided yet, but I'm thinking about either working in a big city like Beijing or Shanghai, or maybe going back to my hometown and starting my own business there. What about you? What are your plans after university?
